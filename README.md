# 🗣️ Deep Dive into Text-to-Speech Models: From Synthesizers to Vocoders! 🚀

## 📖 Repo Primer:

This repository is structured to guide you through a comprehensive exploration of TTS models !!
Here's a roadmap to help you navigate this repository and dive into the exciting world of TTS 

### Essential Links & Resources 🔗
------

#### Links Plethora 📖
   
- Head over to [1_Tutorials_Links.md](1_Tutorials_links.md) to find a curated list of important links, tutorials, and resources to kickstart your learning. 📚

#### Understanding the Building Blocks 🎶 

- Learn all about the different types of synthesizers in [2_types_of_synth.md](2_types_of_synth.md). Discover how they form the core of many TTS systems. 🎹

#### Code Exploration: Getting Your Hands Dirty with TTS 💻

- Dive into the code files folder to explore the Python scripts and implementations. Understand the simple forms of TTS and how they work in practice. 🛠️ [3_expt.md](3_expt.md)

## 💻 Some other details of other folders : 

- [MFCC output/](MFCC%20output) : Contains Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients images -> comes in handy when ur going through 
- [audio_output_2_HMM_based_synthn_2ndTime/](audio_output_2_HMM_based_synthn_2ndTime) : Output audio files from the HMM-based synthesis (second attempt).
- [audio_output_2_HMM_based_synthn_1stTime/](audio_output_2_HMM_based_synthn_1stTime) : Output audio files from the HMM-based synthesis (first attempt).
- [code files/](code%20files) : All the Python code used in this project.
- [spectrogram_output/](spectrogram_output) : Spectrogram visualizations of the audio ( Expt 1 )
- [wav_files/](wav_files) : Raw audio input files.
